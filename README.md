# Udacity - Chicago Bike Share
This repository will store my udacity's project.
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago. 
You wrote a code to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
And also create some important functions and plot charts.
